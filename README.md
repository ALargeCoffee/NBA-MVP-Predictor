# NBA-MVP-Predictor
A neural network model designed to accurately pick a season's MVP based on player stats. Currently a work in progress.

## List of Required Stats (in the Order Required by the Model):
* Age
* G
* MP
* FG%
* 3P%
* 2P%
* eFG%
* FT%
* TRB
* AST
* STL
* BLK
* TOV
* PF
* PTS

These stats were chosen because they all could potentially indicate MVP-level performance, although more could be considered outside this data set.
